# AWS Architecture Design Examples

This repository contains practical AWS architecture design examples focused on real-world use cases.

## Purpose
The goal of this repository is to strengthen architecture design thinking by documenting how AWS solutions are structured, including key decisions and trade-offs across cost, availability, security, and performance.

## What This Repository Covers
- Simple and scalable architecture designs
- High availability and fault-tolerant patterns
- Secure VPC and networking designs
- Clear explanation of architectural trade-offs

## How to Use
Each design is documented as a standalone example under the `designs/` directory and can be reviewed independently.

## Disclaimer
These designs are for learning and reference purposes, based on hands-on exposure and AWS best practices.

## Architecture Designs
The following architecture examples are included:
- Simple Web Application
- Highly Available Web Application
- Secure VPC Design

Each design is documented with use cases, decisions, and trade-offs.

Note: Architecture diagrams will be added in a future update.
